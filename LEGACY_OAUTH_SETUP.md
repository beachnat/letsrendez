# Access Legacy OAuth Consent Screen

## Direct Link to Legacy Interface

Try this link to access the older OAuth consent screen interface:

```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=letsrendez
```

This should take you to the OAuth consent screen configuration page where you can set the app name.

## Alternative: Check Clients

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Clients"**
2. See if there's an OAuth client listed
3. You might need to create one or configure an existing one

## If That Doesn't Work

The app name might already be set elsewhere, or Google might be using a different system. Let's check:

1. Try the direct link above first
2. If that doesn't work, we can check if the name is set in Firebase Console
3. Or we can test the app to see what name actually appears

Let me know what you see when you click the direct link!
