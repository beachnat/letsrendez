# Firebase Project Name - What to Use

## What You're Seeing

When setting up Firebase, you might see:
1. **Project Display Name** - What shows in Firebase Console (just for you)
2. **Project ID** - Used in URLs and config (already set to "letsrendez")
3. **App Nickname** - What you named your web app (e.g., "Let's Rendez Web")

## Do You Need to Change It?

### ✅ **Project ID: "letsrendez"** (Keep This!)

**What it is:**
- Used in Firebase URLs: `letsrendez.firebaseapp.com`
- Already in your config file
- Used in API calls

**Should you change it?**
- **NO** - It's already configured in your app
- Changing it would break your app
- "letsrendez" is perfect - matches your brand

**Where it appears:**
- Firebase URLs
- Your config file (already set)
- Not visible to end users

### 📝 **Project Display Name** (Doesn't Matter)

**What it is:**
- Just a label in Firebase Console
- Only you see it
- Doesn't affect functionality

**What to use:**
- "Let's Rendez" or "letsrendez" - both fine
- Can be anything - just for your organization
- Users never see this

**Should you change it?**
- Only if you want better organization
- Doesn't affect the app at all

### 🏷️ **App Nickname** (Doesn't Matter)

**What it is:**
- Label for your web app in Firebase Console
- Just for organization
- Users never see this

**What to use:**
- "Let's Rendez Web" or "Web App" - both fine
- Doesn't affect functionality

## What End Users See

**End users NEVER see:**
- Project ID
- Display name
- App nickname
- Firebase Console

**End users ONLY see:**
- Your app name: "Let's Rendez"
- Google Sign-In popup (from Google, not Firebase)
- Your app UI

## Recommendation

**Keep everything as-is:**
- ✅ Project ID: "letsrendez" (already set, don't change)
- ✅ Display name: "Let's Rendez" or "letsrendez" (your choice, doesn't matter)
- ✅ App nickname: "Let's Rendez Web" (your choice, doesn't matter)

**Why:**
- Project ID is already configured in your app
- Changing it would require updating config files
- Display names are just for your organization
- Users never see any of these names

## Privacy/Security Note

**Is "letsrendez" too public?**
- Project ID appears in Firebase URLs (not a security issue)
- It's just an identifier, not sensitive
- Many apps use their brand name as project ID
- No security risk

**If you're concerned:**
- You could use something generic like "lr-app-2026"
- But then you'd need to update your config file
- Not necessary - "letsrendez" is fine

## Bottom Line

**Don't change anything!** Your current setup is perfect:
- Project ID "letsrendez" matches your brand
- Already configured in your app
- Display names don't matter (just for you)
- Users never see Firebase project names

Just enable Google Sign-In and you're good to go! 🚀
